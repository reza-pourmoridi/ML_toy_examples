each most used machine learning model with two example, one very easy and other one medium.
plane is solving each model easy example...based on my desire and then medium ones and then going for two harder real examples.
each example , if its possible... first sohould be solved with pure python and pure math... then using python libraries.

Linear Regression:
Easy: Predicting the price of a house based on its square footage.
Medium: Estimating the sales of a product based on advertising expenditure and historical sales data.



Logistic Regression:
Easy: Predicting whether an email is spam or not based on the presence of certain keywords.
Medium: Identifying whether a student will pass or fail an exam based on study hours and previous exam scores.


Decision Trees:
Easy: Predicting whether a person likes a specific genre of music based on their age and favorite color.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Medium: Classifying loan applications as approved or denied based on various financial factors.


Random Forest:
Easy: Predicting whether a customer will buy a product online based on browsing history and time spent on the website.
Medium: Diagnosing a medical condition (e.g., diabetes) based on a combination of patient history and test results.


Support Vector Machines (SVM):
Easy: Classifying handwritten digits (e.g., recognizing digits 0 and 1).
Medium: Predicting whether a customer will churn (leave) a subscription service based on usage patterns and customer feedback.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
Easy: Recommending movies to a user based on the ratings of users with similar tastes.
